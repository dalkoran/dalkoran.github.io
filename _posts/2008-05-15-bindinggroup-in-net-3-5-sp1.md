<P>Of all the new features trumpeted for .NET 3.5 SP1 recently the one bullet point that really caught my attention was this little gem (from <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/">Brad Adams blog</A>).</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A new BindingGroup in System.Windows.Data (additional databinding support)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>At this stage I haven't downloaded and installed the bits. Anyone know what this "BindingGroup" refers to - I haven't heard/seen it mentioned anywhere else. <BR><BR>
<P>[<SPAN style="COLOR: red"><STRONG>Update 28-May-2008</STRONG>:</SPAN>The <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jgoldb/archive/2008/05/15/what-s-new-for-performance-in-wpf-in-net-3-5-sp1.aspx">WPF Performance blog</A>&nbsp;provides some further hints on the purpose of BindingGroup]</P><STRONG>Item-Level Validation - </STRONG>By using Binding Groups this applies validation rules to an entire bound item. For example it can enable validate &amp; commit scenario for a form with few bind-able edit fields. (available in final RTM bits only)
