Some <a href="http://windowsclient.net/jobs/#cider" target="_blank">great sounding jobs up for grabs at Redmond</a>. It appears his soul is currently consumed with <a href="http://www.paulstovell.net/blog/index.php/fluent-synclinq-tests/" target="_blank">LINQ</a> but based on his astute observations <a href="http://paulstovell.net/blog/index.php/evolution-of-the-wpf-designer/" target="_blank">here</a> I think maybe <a href="http://www.paulstovell.net/" target="_blank">Paul</a> should be applying for a decision making position on the Cider team!
 

The more that I play with WPF (my real job is still WinForms) the more I'm amazed at how unhelpful the Visual Studio WPF designer (Cider) is. I can't imagine that anyone actually uses it to layout form content. What's worse there are even third party tools that seem to do a much quicker and more robust job of previewing XAML markup "as you type". 
 

I've started using <a href="http://www.kaxaml.com" target="_blank">Kaxaml</a> in preference to Visual Studio for hand hacking WPF fragments - its just quicker and doesn't require so many restarts ![](http://blog.spencen.com/emoticons/sad.png). What was really surprising is that it even does a better job of XAML Intellisense!
 

Yet there are things that I really yearn for in the WPF designer. Particularly a resource manager - at a simple level just a treeview showing all the resources defined in my application/project. Also a better way of visualizing data binding at a high level would be a great bonus.
