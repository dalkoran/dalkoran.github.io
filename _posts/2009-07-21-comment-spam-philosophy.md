<P>Recently I’ve been getting quite a bit of comment spam on this blog. Most of it is inane gibberish, a witless praise or a text fragment ripped from the post itself. However, some of it is actually quite entertaining…</P>

<P><EM>Although Google does not care much about links inside comments, Google cares about links INSIDE the posts. Get people to notice you, and they will eventually write about you and your site. Links inside posts are the best quality backlinks you can get. To sum it all up, always write great comments if you are going to write them, and you will be rewarded sooner or later.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Hmm – spam that tells me comment links are not really worth anything.</P>

<P><EM>I admit, I have not been on this webpage in a long time... however it was another joy to see It is such an important topic and ignored by so many, even professionals. I thank you to help making people more aware of possible issues. <BR>Great stuff as usual....</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Well what can I say – its good to have you back.</P>

<P><EM>The scoop neck and cap sleeves are cute, the gathers at the waist creates a uniformly flattering silhouette, and the pattern of the dye compliments beautifully the design of the dress!..</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Why – thank you so much, I designed it myself :-p</P>

<P><EM>Find effective graphics and photos: It's always better to use too few than too many graphics. One great graphic is so much better than four weak ones. Sometimes they are not even necessary. When you do use graphics and photos, make sure they help illustrate your point, rather than just inserting them to take up space.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Err… OK – use a few good graphics… when necessary… but not more than four… and make them relevant not as padding. Even graphic designers are spamming!?</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
