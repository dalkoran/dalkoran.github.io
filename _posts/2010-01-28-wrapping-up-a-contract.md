This is my last week at my current employer. I’ve been spending most of my time updating the Wiki, doing some last minute branding changes, commenting code and general housekeeping.
  

The project I’ve been working on for the last 18 months was called “Automation of Movements” – nicknamed to AoM. I came across the little gem that [Dave](http://david.gardiner.net.au/) posted to the project Wiki very early in the development cycle.

*Ten years ago, a crack IT-commando unit was sent to prison by a static code analyser for a bug they didn't create. These men promptly escaped from a Triple-DES security stockade to the Adelaide underground. Today, still wanted by the government/higher education and private sectors, they survive as developers of fortune. If you have a software problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire... The AoM-Team.*
  

Gold Dave, pure gold.
