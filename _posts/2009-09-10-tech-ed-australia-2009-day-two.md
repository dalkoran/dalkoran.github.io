First – here’s a few blog posts which cover some of the sessions I went to yesterday – but in much more detail. I’d recommend both blogs if you’re not already subscribed.
  

Windows Mobile Marketplace - [http://www.techau.tv/blog/?p=2106](http://www.techau.tv/blog/?p=2106)
  

Starting a Small Software Enterprise - [http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2009/09/how-to-build-small-software-enterprise.html](http://richardsbraindump.blogspot.com/2009/09/how-to-build-small-software-enterprise.html)
  

Everyone that attended yesterday’s session on the Windows Mobile Marketplace was also sent an e-mail this afternoon to let us know the information we were given regarding the regional pricing policy was incorrect. The price is actually an additional $10 per region, not $99 which I think it quite acceptable. See [Jame’s blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/lokeuei/archive/2009/09/09/clarification-submitting-apps-to-additional-regions-through-marketplace.aspx) for details.
  

#### DEV310 Make Some Magic! Shake, Flip and Flick Your Application for Windows Mobile 6.5! 

  

This talk began with a brief introduction of marketplace and the Race to Market Challenge. This was then followed by a good discussion around new and emerging phone capabilities which included an interesting video of some folk who have developed a multi-touch resistive screen technology. This means you get multi-touch, pressure sensitivity and fine grain accuracy.
  

Unfortunately for me a large part of the talk was based around how you can use the great open source [sensor API](http://sensorapi.codeplex.com ) to access hardware specific phone features such as accelerometers and light sensors.Would have been interesting for those that hadn’t seen it before – but otherwise just a run through of the provided demos apps.
  

There was also a quick demonstration of how easy it is to write your own gesture recognition engine for pre 6.5 phones. Simple but very effective.
  

#### DEV350 What is new in VS2010 &amp; .NET FX 4.0... and what should you be using in your next project?

  

The session speaker was Adam Cogan. I tried to listen to him… I really did. But he’s just so annoying!
  

He spends all his time going off on irrelevant tangents or trying to amuse the audience. Then creeps through the content at a snails pace [hmm… can snails creep?]. His endless audience questions quickly become tiresome too. What makes it even more annoying is that he’s always getting/picking great topics for Tech-Ed sessions. Its just that the delivery is so poor. But then its probably just me. I I always give him a 1 on the review and if everybody else did the same he wouldn’t get the gigs right? Guess I’ll just notch it down to a personality clash – just hoping next year that he decides to do a talk on something less interesting. 
  

I didn’t manage to sit through this talk to the end. A good coffee was much more enjoyable.
  

#### DEV320 Visual Studio 2008 IDE Tips

  

I thought this session would be entertaining though I consider myself fairly familiar with Visual Studio’s IDE (I should be after 7 years) and wasn’t expecting too many surprises. Having said that I came away with at least 5 tips that I certainly intend to apply to my everyday workflow. We didn’t even have to take notes because Sara had [posted them](http://blogs.msdn.com/saraford/archive/2009/09/09/teched-australia-25-visual-studio-2008-ide-tips.aspx) just prior to her talk. My favourites were 5, 15 (esp. when used to execute from find combo) and 22. Another great session by Sara.
  

#### SQL209 Project Gemini: Self-Service Business Intelligence

  

This was all new for me. Essentially it seems to be providing business analysis functionality using Excel as the design tool – very much end-user oriented. Support for Excel Services (via SharePoint), using Analysis Services transparently with scheduled updating of data sources. The demo was very well delivered I was impressed in how the convergence of Excel, SharePoint, Silverlight, Reporting Services and Analysis Services worked seamlessly to produce the output.
  

To top it off the presenter showed how the project Gemini Excel add-in could sort and filter 101 million rows in real time (sub-second) even when running on a HP Mini netbook. All via an in-memory data engine and clever use of compression.
  

Its being delivered as part of SQL 2008 R2 together with Office 2010.
