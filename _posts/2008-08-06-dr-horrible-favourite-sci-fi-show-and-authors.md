For fans of Joss Whedon – creator of [Firefly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)) (a brilliant, though short-lived Sci-Fi series) comes “[Dr Horrible](http://www.drhorrible.com/)”. This is a three act musical comedy that he made during the writer’s strike (ie. no studio involvement). Definitely worth watching! [Joss also did *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* (but I forgive him) hence he has a cult following that melted the servers they originally posted this to. An additional 2.2 million downloads in its first week on iTunes too.]
  

I also get surprised by the number of people that haven’t read [Iain M Banks](http://www.iain-banks.net/) book – my favourite sci-fi author (though he does contemporary fiction too). There’s a great intro on the Culture civilization that spans many of his books [here](http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~stefan/culture.html). 
  

I guess while I’m at it, if you’re doing fantasy fiction is there really anyone better that [Guy Gavriel Kay](http://www.brightweavings.com/)?
