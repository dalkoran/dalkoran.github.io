<P>The attached <A href="http://silverlight.services.live.com/72225/Sync%20Services%20for%20ADO.NET%20Presentation/video.wmv">clip</A> is a screencast of a recent 10 minute presentation I gave at CodeCampSA.</P>
<P>Its the first in what is hopefully a series of clips which walk through how I’ve been building an application called <EM>Holiday Planner</EM> (working title). </P>
<P>WARNING: I talk fast, and I’ve got an Australian accent <IMG src="http://blog.spencen.com/emoticons/smile.png" border=0>. I’d suggest using the <A href="http://silverlight.services.live.com/72225/Sync%20Services%20for%20ADO.NET%20Presentation/video.wmv">link</A> to view in full res (1024x768).</P>
