![CodeCampSA 2009 - Dates](/images/CodeCampSA%202009%20-%20Dates_6.png "CodeCampSA 2009 - Dates")CodeCampSA organised by the Adelaide .NET User Group (ADNUG) is on again this year on the weekend of 18-19th July. Same venue as last year at Uni SA “City West” campus. For more details about the venue and to keep up to date on who will be speaking (and what they’ll be speaking about) visit the new website at [www.codecampsa.com](http://www.codecampsa.com). Kudos go to [David Gardiner](http://david.gardiner.net.au) for putting the site together!
  

So if you are in Adelaide make sure you take some time out of your weekend to come along. I’ll be amongst those presenting but don’t let that deter you!
