Tonight I downloaded and installed the official [Windows Mobile 6.5 ROM (SE Asia)](http://www.htc.com/sea/SupportViewNews.aspx?dl_id=737&amp;news_id=319) on my [HTC Touch Diamond 2](http://blog.spencen.com/2009/06/24/htc-touch-diamond2.aspx). I’d previously used [Microsoft My Phone](http://myphone.microsoft.com) software to back up all my personal data (excluding SD card) to the cloud. The re-install process worked flawlessly putting ringtones, contacts, <strike>favourites</strike>, text message history etc. back just the way they were prior to flashing the ROM – very nice.
  

However, I’d like to see My Phone do more, specifically:
  

*   Backup/restore mail settings (most importantly POP) 
*   Backup/restore bookmarks for Opera Browser (default on HTC device) – even if converted to IE8 favourites 
*   Merge duplicate contacts – the option is there on the website – but it seems to just check for exact duplicates. I want it to merge details for entries that have the same name, e.g. contact listing with IM details, another with phone, yet another with email – merged into a single contact. 
*   Less obnoxious advertisements on the website.
