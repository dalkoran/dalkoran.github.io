Just finished watching [Billy Hollis demo a WPF application on dnrTV](http://dnrtv.com/default.aspx?showID=115) that he and his business partners have been working on for one of their clients. I thought it was a great example of how a WPF application can take advantage of WPFs strengths to add some new UI interaction around common requirements for line of business applications. These included things like navigation, dirty checking, modal forms etc. Well worth watching. Billy also commented that the application was put together *without* the aid of a UI designer â€“ just three developers with a bent for good UI design.
