Never used Digg.com but I've had [this simple tune](http://www.techau.tv/blog/?p=271) in my head since the following a link to it from [techAU's](http://www.techau.tv/blog) blog last night. Not even sure whether SuperBowl is baseball or grid-iron - but I love the marketing power of the Internet that have been used to promote this. Even more so since the Gotta Digg song is only being used in the campaign - its not even the actual song she's submitted for the competition.
