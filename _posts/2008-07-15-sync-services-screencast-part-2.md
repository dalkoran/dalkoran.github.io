I’ve just uploaded Part 2 of my screencast on Occasionally Connected Application using Sync Services for ADO.NET.

You can via [this link](http://silverlight.services.live.com/72225/Sync%20Services%20for%20ADO.NET%20Presentation%20Part%202/video.wmv). This 12 minute screencast contains some of the features that I wanted to cover in the Part 1 demo presentation but just couldn’t fit into the allotted 10 minutes.

Next I’m planning to do a quick 10 minute intro of the Holiday Planner application (for those that have been wondering about the logo in the screencast). Then at least one screencast talking about the power of using WPF ItemsControls in conjunction with DataTemplates.
