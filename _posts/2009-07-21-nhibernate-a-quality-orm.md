*[This is a flame. If you are an NHibernate fan, please stop reading now, you’ll only upset yourself otherwise.]*
  

Like many others I subscribe to the [codebetter.com](http://codebetter.com/blogs/) RSS feed. One of the members feels that its their personal responsibility to enlighten subscribers with endless NDepend analysis results for various frameworks. I *almost* always skip those posts.
  

However, this [latest post](http://codebetter.com/blogs/patricksmacchia/archive/2009/07/21/nhibernate-2-1-changes-overview.aspx) regarding the NHibernate 2.1 release I found most amusing.
  

I’ve been *subjected* to NHibernate. I don’t enjoy the experience. Some of the pain that I’ve felt begins to make sense. 58,000 lines of spaghetti code to do some pretty simple ORM mapping – woot! {snigger}
