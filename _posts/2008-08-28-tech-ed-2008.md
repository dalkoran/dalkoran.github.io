I’m off to [Tech Ed 2008 in Sydney](http://www.microsoft.com.au/teched/) next week – courtesy of Microsoft and their [Demos Happen {Here}](http://www.microsoft.com/australia/heroes/community.aspx) competition. I hadn’t planned on going this year but its hard to turn down free tickets! I even have a 10 minute slot to present during afternoon tea on the first day.
