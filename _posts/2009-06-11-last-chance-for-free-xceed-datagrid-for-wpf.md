The folks over at [Xceed](http://www.xceed.com) have decided that their free [WPF DataGrid Express](http://xceed.com/Grid_WPF_Intro.html) product really is too good a deal to be true ![](http://blog.spencen.com/emoticons/smile.png). As of 3 days from now they will start charging $300 for the Express version. If you get in quick you can still get hold of it for free! So what are you waiting for – head on over to [xceed.com/freegrid](http://xceed.com/freegrid).
