Haven't posted for a while - I've been absorbing the flurry of good content that been blogged recently. Some of my favourites.
 

[Prism Camp](http://neverindoubtnet.blogspot.com/2008/01/prism-camp-reflections-on-composite-wpf.html)" describing the working party that was put together to help kick off the project quite fascinating. [Side note to self: Ward is the product manager for DevForce.NET - interesting.]</li></ul> 

[officially released](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc468366.aspx).</li></ul> 

[ties in with data binding](http://karlshifflett.wordpress.com/2008/04/03/wpf-sample-series-handling-and-reporting-wpf-data-binding-validation-errors-and-exceptions/).  <li>This is closely aligned with some [stuff I looked into](http://blog.spencen.com/2007/10/28/more-thoughts-on-validation.aspx) when I [first started playing with WPF](http://blog.spencen.com/2007/10/15/validation-engine.aspx).</li></ul>
