After much “mulling-over” I finally decided to get a Wireless Internet account. I looked into each of the obvious Vendors – [3](www.three.com.au), [Optus](www.optus.com.au) and [Vodafone](www.vodafone.com.au). Of those only Optus had a pre-paid service – the other two offered only 24 month plans that required a credit check and lots of stupid questions. On closer inspection though Optus’s 2Gb for $30 pre-paid plan began to look less inviting. In addition the pre-paid blocks expire after 30 days and the fine print states that usage is measured in 10Mb increments. So connecting and downloading a 1Kb file will accrue 10Mb of usage! On a 2Gb plan that’s only 200 individual connections?!
  

As it turned out the best plan for me was the least obvious. Telstra. Yep – that’s right – Telstra. Apparently since 24-Aug-2008 their ludicrously expensive Wireless broadband plans have dropped to become well err… just very expensive. A 1Gb plan now only costs $60 per month on a 36 month plan. But here’s the deal-making points for me:
  

*   No credit checks and stupid questions – even if you’re not an existing customer (which I am). 
*   Modem included in price. 
*   Best coverage. 
*   Ability to change up/down quota with no penalties. 
*   *Half price for first 12 months* – making it on par with best 3 and Optus plans. 
*   At the end of 12 months simply drop the plan and rejoin for another 12 months at half price. Plan cancellation fee of $240 – which I’m willing to pay above and beyond Optus and 3 for:        
&#160;&#160; 12 month plan instead of 24 month,         
&#160;&#160; better coverage,         
&#160;&#160; better joining experience.   

Trust me I was amazed as anyone – I now have a Bigpond account. This morning I would have expected the end of time to have occurred prior to that event happening.
  

I live in an area where the exchange is declared by Telstra as “full” and hence ADSL 2 is not available. I found a nifty web site – [www.speedtest.net](http://www.speedtest.net) – and ran two tests. [Seriously if you haven’t already seen speedtest go check it out – its a very slick looking web-app.]

Unfortunately I’m unlikely to ever use that speed. The 1Gb plan is just enough for e-mail, messenger and occasional web browsing whilst I’m on the move.
