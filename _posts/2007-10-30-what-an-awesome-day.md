Today was a great day for me. 
 

It didn't start off to well. I overslept, missed breakfast with my son, and only just got to work on time. 
 

Things picked up a little from there - I've been working on some seriously cool custom grid rendering at work for a prototype app. Basically bending the standard WinForms DataGridView to do row grouping with headers and calculated footers, expand, collapse, switching between single line and multi-line preview etc. So an hour or so of coding bliss...
 

Around midday I was giving a talk on Windows Vista as part of a series of "lunchbox" education sessions I've been trying to get off the ground at work. I'd spent a good portion of previous night setting up my machine with demos. However, when I went to set up my machine at work I realised that my machine has only two DVI outputs and there I am stuck with no DVI to analog connectors - so I can't connect it to the projector. Ended up doing an "off-the-cuff" presentation using a Vista Business machine - but via remote desktop so no Aero Glass ![](http://blog.spencen.com/emoticons/sad.png). I think I pulled it off but was a little disappointed.
 

I get some **really** good news later in the afternoon - more than makes up for any of the days minor inconveniences. At this point the day is already a *Very Good Day*.
 

Tonight I left early (before 6pm) so I could take my son and daughter swimming. Before we leave for the pool I set the latest <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/" target="_blank">dotnetrocks</a> show to download. The kids have a great time at swimming - which by proxy means so do I. Now its a *Great Day*.
 

On the way home I remember that today is the 30th October and why that's important. I bundle the kids out the car and we listen to the first 10 minutes of <a href="http://perseus.franklins.net/dotnetrocks_0285_david_yack.wma" target="_blank">episode 285 of dotnetrocks</a>. Now I'm not sure how much pre-schoolers get out of listening to dotnetrocks normally - but even they get excited when they hear my name read out as one of the two winners of a 24" LCD monitor! Or maybe they just got excited because I* *was jumping up and down and shouting?
 

Day status - *Awesome*!

Big thanks to Microsoft Europe for the prize and Carl and Richard for an awesome show. I wonder what I'll get in the mail first - the <a href="http://blog.spencen.com/2007/10/04/winner.aspx" target="_blank">Brain Bag</a> or the monitor?
