After having had quite a bit of [this website](http://blogs.msdn.com/pix/pages/extras.aspx).
  

[Photosynth](http://photosynth.net/) is awesome, but it requires that all photos be public at this stage. [AutoCollage](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/autocollage/) I had tried out before and whilst it is kinda cute, I preferr having more custom control in the layout (hence my PhotoPlay app a few years ago).
  

The [Image Composite Editor](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/groups/ivm/ICE/) (apart from having a truly uninspiring name) seem to essentially be the engine that Windows Live Photo Gallery uses under the hood to perform its own “Create panoramic photo” feature. Of course the Image Composite Editor (ICE) allows you to get more involved in how the composite stitching is performed. It also has quite a few export options, including: HD View Tileset, Adobe Photoshop, Deepzoom Tileset or just plan jpg or png.

I did some experiments with the HD View Tileset option. What I liked about this was it allows you to view the image whilst getting a better perspective of the rotational span. Kind of like printing out a panoramic strip and then wrapping it around your head about 15cm from your eyes whist spanning the correct angle of the composite. Err… ok – that wasn’t a great explanation – try the links below.
