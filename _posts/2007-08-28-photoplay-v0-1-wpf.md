Err... well it sure don't do much yet but if you just can't get enough of spinning a photo around then [here](http://www.spencen.com/install/PhotoPLayWPF/publish.htm) is the ClickOnce install.
 

So far I've tackled some very simple DependencyPropertys, binding, control templating and event triggers. As I always find when learning something like this from scratch - simple things can take a long time. The only reference that I've used so far aside from the MSDN help is an <a href="http://www.dnrtv.com/default.aspx?showNum=72" target="_blank">excellent intro to writing WPF custom controls</a> by <a href="http://doitwith.net/" target="_blank">Mark Miller</a> in a recent episode of <a href="http://www.dnrTV.com" target="_blank">dnrTV</a>.
