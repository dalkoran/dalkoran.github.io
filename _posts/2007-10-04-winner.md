Wow - I just listened to <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com" target="_blank">Dot Net Rocks!</a> Show #277 on the way home from work tonight. Turns out I was this weeks winner as part of their <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/barcelona" target="_blank">Tech Ed Barcelona competition</a> and have gone in the draw to win one of two 24" 1900x1200 LCD monitors! In addition they're sending me a <a href="http://www.tombihn.com/page/001/PROD/300/TB0104" target="_blank">Tom Binh Brain Bag</a>. Woo-hoo!
 

I've been mentioned on Dot Net Rocks! (albeit as a random selection) - I think my life may now be complete ![](http://blog.spencen.com/emoticons/smile.png).
