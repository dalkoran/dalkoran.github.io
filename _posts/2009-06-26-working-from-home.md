For the last week and a half I’ve been lucky enough to take some leave and work on some of my own (unpaid) projects. Here’s a few simple observations from that experience…
  

The view from my study window is better than the view from my third floor city office.

The coffee is better, closer and comes with snacks.

No background chatter, instead I have the rare opportunity to really crank up the music – awesome boost to developer productivity!

No 2+ hour commute. On the surface this would seem to be a huge benefit, but it does come with drawbacks. My daily commute normally involves walking 4km and I get precious little other daily exercise these days. Also, commute time via bus is my allocated reading and podcast listening time – so I’ve been getting a little behind there.
  

I also got to watch my son participate in his first Grand Prix event – priceless!

Overall a great experience. I thoroughly recommend it!
  

I wonder if they’d notice at work if I took a couple more weeks off?
