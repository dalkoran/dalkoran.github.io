For the first time in around 20 years I'm about to be un-employed. Don't worry, its not quite as radical as all that - I've already signed a contract and am looking forward to starting a new position on the 10th December. But since I finish with my current employer on Friday that means 1 week of un-employment. I am so looking forward to that! 

To celebrate the occasion my wife decided we needed to go on holiday. Low stress - so no driving, no busy schedule of activities, no rushing... hmm... in other words just about the opposite of every holiday we've ever taken. So she's picked somewhere fairly remote - with no cars or shops, just beaches, pools and food. Sounds great, "but does it have broadband" I ask? 

So last weekend I think about packing and get out my trusty old Toshiba laptop. Now the only time I ever use this thing is when we go on holidays. With horror I discover that the backlight has failed. Now I have a very slow, fully functional notebook with no screen. 

I'm still waiting for my .NET Rocks [www.tegatech.com.au](http://www.tegatech.com.au). Now it turns out Hugo is in the wrong game - as far as I can tell from the phone and e-mail conversations I had with him he's human. So why is he selling computers? Beats me - but (pending arrival of my machine on Friday morning) I wholeheartedly recommend him! He's even a Microsoft MVP - oh turns out he's the <a href="https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/profile=5CFB3DCD-DAAA-41B6-ABB1-8763CCAB9711" target="_blank">legendary Tablet PC Guy</a>!
