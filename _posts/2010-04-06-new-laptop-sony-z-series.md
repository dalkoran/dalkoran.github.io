The last two months have been pretty hectic for me… new job, new residence, new country/continent/hemisphere.
  

When we moved I packed all my desktop computers (dev box, HTPC, Home Server and son’s PC) into storage. This means for the last two months I’ve been using my [Fujitsu tablet PC](http://blog.spencen.com/2007/11/28/a-new-toy.aspx) for all my computing requirements, occasionally also resorting to my HP mini notebook.
  

The plan was to purchase a desktop PC when we got settled in – something powerful enough to by a good dev box and occasional gaming. However – two things quickly became apparent to me. Firstly – purchasing computer hardware in the US is not as convenient as I first imagined.
  

*   Online delivery times for most sites (including Dell and Sony) were measured in weeks – I want next day delivery!
*   It’s nowhere near as cheap as I had hoped – especially when you always need to add taxes 
*   Laptops are cheaper to buy than desktops once you include screens, keyboards, wireless etc. Of course this point is debatable based on your requirements.  

My requirements were:
  

*   I5 or I7 processor 
*   Minimum 4Gb RAM 
*   Dedicated mid-range graphics card
*   Dual monitor – with at least one 1920 x 1080 display  

Nice to have: 
  

*   120+ Gb SSD drive 
*   Wireless N  

The desktops I priced that matched these requirements were priced around $1200. Too expensive! I deliberated for two weeks, trying to find cheaper alternatives – including building a machine from components (which is how I normally buy desktop PCs) and then finally gave up. Figuring I was going to have to spend that kind of money I decided to look at higher end laptops that offered equivalent power. Eventually I settled on the new [Sony Z Series](http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=8198552921644570897&amp;parentCategoryId=16154) together with a cheap 24 inch screen.

Pros
  

*   Light – seriously light – much lighter than my Tablet PC – 3 lbs / 1.3kg
*   I5 processor 
*   Dual graphics – dedicated when you need it then drops back automatically to use integrated for lower power use 
*   Wireless N / Bluetooth 
*   Reasonable battery life – 5 hours 
*   SSD drive is awesome 
*   Comes with a really nice set of active noise cancelling bud-style headphones 
*   Keyboard looks gimmicky – but actually works really well, has a really solid feel, possibly the best laptop keyboard I’ve used. This was really quite a surprise.
*   Ambient light detector used to automatically set screen brightness (and optionally backlights keyboard) – works really well in our dimly lit apartment or when working near a window during the day. 
*   HDMI connection to 1920 x 1080 monitor – including sound (though the monitor I bought has ridiculously terrible speakers).  

Cons
  

*   Doesn’t read original memory sticks – it has a MagicGate slot – presumable only takes the Duo format? 
*   Its expensive when you can get a lot of *reasonable* laptops for around half the price.
