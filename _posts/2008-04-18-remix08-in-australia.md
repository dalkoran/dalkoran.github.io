Well I've booked my flight, [registered](http://www.microsoft.com/australia/remix08/index.aspx) and got the day off work (in that order). I am **not** a "web guy". I'll go on record as stating that I was over JavaScript and HTML back in 2000. Whilst it was kinda fun to play with for a couple of months I'm not about to go writing any serious applications with those technologies. [I'll leave that to the hordes of happy web devs who somehow seem to enjoy it.]
 

Regardless I was very impressed with the content that I saw coming out of Mix08 this year. In particular being such a WPF fan I think Silverlight 2 is sounding pretty sweet. Maybe, just maybe, I'll convert from writing enterprise client-apps and do some web front-end development? As long as you promise I don't have to touch a scripting language or HTML right? ![](http://blog.spencen.com/emoticons/smile.png)

So who else is going to ReMIX08? Anyone from Adelaide making the early morning flight over to Melbourne on 22nd May?
 

Oh - and a complimentary copy of Expression Studio 2 - nice!
