Purchased a [new book](http://mkaku.org/books-tv-film/physics_of_the_impossible.php) I've been meeting to get for a while now. Ordered through [www.fishpond.com.au](http://www.fishpond.com.au) (cheaper/faster/better than [Amazon](http://blog.spencen.com/2007/09/05/little-to-report.aspx)). Purchase inspired via an interview with the author [Michio Kaku](http://mkaku.org/) on an [old episode of Hanselminutes](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=119).
