One of the features of [Microsoft's Mesh](http://www.mesh.com) is to provide a remote desktop connection to any of your devices via the Live Desktop. That amounts to being able to remote desktop from any of the supported browsers. Microsoft's [Windows Home Server](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/windowshomeserver/default.mspx) [already provides me with this experience](http://blog.spencen.com/2007/10/17/whs-remote-access.aspx) and whilst I can't say I've used it a lot - it has helped me out a few times in a big way. 
 

I had assumed that the technology involved in the Window Home Server remote desktop via the browser was the same technology that would be powering Window Live Mesh. Whether it is or not I can't tell - but the user experience is certainly different.
 

When you connect to Live Mesh it starts a remote desktop session in a window - complete with the standard "Mesh" sidebar window "clipped" onto the right hand edge. What's odd though is that the remote desktop uses the resolution of the remote hardware and is scaled to fit in the window - and the scaling does **not** preserve the aspect ratio. So in my scenario - lets say I connect to my home desktop via my [Fujitsu Lifebook](http://blog.spencen.com/2007/11/28/a-new-toy.aspx). That means I'm viewing a 1920x1200 + 1280x1024 multi-monitor desktop on a laptop screen with a resolution of 1024x768. Umm... not very useful - showing a 3200x1200 very wide desktop squished to a 1024x768 display. It has a mode that allows switching between actual and fixed size - but at those resolutions its kinda akin to using remote desktop from a PDA into a PC - peering through a tiny window and endless scrolling.
 

[Connect](http://connect.microsoft.com) will help shape the product.

I'm still waiting on an invite to the developer Tech Preview to see what the Live Mesh APIs look like.
 

P.S. The folder sharing Live Mesh stuff seems to be working very nicely. I already prefer it to [FolderShare](https://www.foldershare.com/welcome.aspx).
