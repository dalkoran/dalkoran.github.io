[Remix09](http://www.microsoft.com/australia/remix/) not for software bargains, but because of the quality of last year’s event. Presumably the [GFC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_financial_crisis_of_2008) meant that the event was only held in Sydney this year. Here’s my take on the conference this year.
  

### Good![Windows Mobile 6.5 Development](/images/Windows%20Mobile%206.5%20Development_1.png "Windows Mobile 6.5 Development")

  

*   Keynote was packed with lots of good Aussie demos. 
*   [Matt Morphett](http://mattmorphett.blogspot.com/) on design prototyping and [Sketchflow](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2009/04/25/prototyping-with-sketchflow.aspx) – for me he was the outstanding presenter of the day. [Make sure you check out the video when it comes online late next week.] 
*   Silverlight 3 and Expression 3 demos – behaviours, blend visual state manager support, animation easing, 2.5D, shaders etc. 
*   Windows Mobile 6.5 was demoed along with plans for the Australian launch and overview of the “Marketplace” to compete with “fruit phone”. Check out the Australian [dev centre](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-au/developer/default.mspx). 
*   <strike>Virtual Earth</strike> <strike>Live</strike> Bing Maps for Silverlight. Some nice demos – I liked the GIS integration.   

### Bad

  

*   Internet connections. Its a shame that every time I attend a Microsoft conference in Australia the available internet connection sucks. It’s bad enough that the delegates get WiFi that drops out and 3G/NextG saturation, but when the presenters can’t get a reliable/performant connection if really affects demos. 
*   Seating was a bit quishy in Ballroom 3. OK – if that’s all I’ve got to complain about I’m thinking this must have been a pretty good day ![](http://blog.spencen.com/emoticons/smile.png).   

### Remix10?

  

There seems to be a question mark around having a Remix conference at all next year. I for one would be disappointed not to see the event return.
