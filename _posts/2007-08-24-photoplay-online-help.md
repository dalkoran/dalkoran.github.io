If a folder is selected all existing images on the page will be removed and replaced by the images from the folder. <br>Note: currently **all** files will be loaded - non-image files will be displayed using just their filename. The reason for this is that the actual image data is loaded in the background after the files are enumerated and displayed as square placeholders.</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="122">Exit</td> <td valign="top" width="502">Closes the application.</td></tr></tbody></table>

That is the photo is zoomed but the actual frame stays the same size - thus the entire image is no longer visible. Together with Panning this allows images to be re-composed. For example to remove unwanted sections and to focus in on the subject - or simply to create a more appealing framing.<br>Select the photo to be zoomed then **hold down the ctrl key** whilst using the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and out.<br><a href="/images/image_1.png" atomicselection="true">![image](/images/image_thumb_1.png)</a><br>Ctrl-"-" and Ctrl-"+" keys can also be used to zoom photos.</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="200">To Move a Photo</td> <td valign="top" width="416">Left click on any area of a photo except the corner grips and whilst holding down the left mouse button drag.
