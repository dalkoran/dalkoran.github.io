Tonight on the commute home I listened to a recent [DNR](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/) podcast ([show 349](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=349)) where Carl and Richard interview Scott Hunter a program manager on the ASP.NET team working on [Dynamic Data](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/dynamicdata). I’ve heard enough about the topic before (e.g. [his interview with Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=127)) to understand the basics. But what I really liked about the DNR interview was when Scott described that their intent to have it work with multiple client technologies – web forms, MVC ASP.NET, Silverlight and one would have to assume WPF.
  

The [Dynamic Data attributes](http://blogs.msdn.com/mairaw/default.aspx) have been specifically placed in a UI agnostic namespace – System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations. It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy when I see the MS teams communicating or thinking “big picture”. I’m still hopeful we might get a System.ComponentModel.Validation namespace?
