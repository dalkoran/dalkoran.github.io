<P>I had a lot of fun late this afternoon putting together a Desk Calendar UserControl. The idea was triggered by me using a screenshot of the Vista Calendar Gadget in my <A href="http://blog.spencen.com/2009/06/23/codecampsa-2009.aspx">last post</A>. Also I’m working on a project at the moment that could use a nice date/calendar display and my previous WinForms attempts never looked that great.</P>
<P align=left>Believing that imitation is the greatest form of flattery – here is my new Desk Calendar UserControl in all its glory. Of course being WPF its fully zoomable – no nasty bitmaps here – click the image to see it at higher res.</P>
<P><A href="/images/DeskCalendar.png"><IMG style="BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px; DISPLAY: block; FLOAT: none; BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto" title=DeskCalendar border=0 alt=DeskCalendar src="/images/DeskCalendar.png" width=128 height=240></A> </P>
<P>For the moment the control is read-only, although I did start working on a “flip page” animation. The layout was done exclusively in Blend (v3 Preview) hence the mark-up has some redundant elements and over-precise co-ords. In general though I was really happy with how easy this was to put together using Blend – the product has certainly matured well.<BR><BR>[Edit: Source code and XBAP demo can be found on subsequent post <A href="http://blog.spencen.com/2009/06/24/desk-calendar-usercontrol-ndash-source-code.aspx">here</A>.]</P>
