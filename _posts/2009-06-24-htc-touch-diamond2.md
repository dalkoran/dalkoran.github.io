Inspired by what I saw at Remix regarding the launch of Windows Mobile 6.5 I figured that since my phone is on the fritz now must be the time to get a new one. For me the phone has to be a Windows Mobile device and by all the reviews Iâ€™ve looked at in the last couple of days the HTC devices seem to be the most well thought of.
  

So the order is placed. I should be getting an unlocked HTC Touch Diamond2 in the next few days. Cooked ROMS running Windows Mobile 6.5 are already available and I already have the WM6.5 SDK installed on my dev box.
