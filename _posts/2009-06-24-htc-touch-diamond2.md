Inspired by what I saw at Remix regarding the launch of Windows Mobile 6.5 I figured that since my phone is on the fritz now must be the time to get a new one. For me the phone has to be a Windows Mobile device and by all the reviews I’ve looked at in the last couple of days the HTC devices seem to be the most well thought of.
  

So the order is placed. I should be getting an unlocked HTC Touch Diamond2 in the next few days. Cooked ROMS running Windows Mobile 6.5 are already available and I already have the WM6.5 SDK installed on my dev box.
