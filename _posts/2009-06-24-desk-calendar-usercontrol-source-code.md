I had to remove the source code from my [previous post](http://blog.spencen.com/2009/06/24/desk-calendar-usercontrol.aspx) because it was doing weird things to my RSS feed. For those that may be interested though a sample project file can be found [here](http://www.spencen.com/Downloads/DesktopCalendar.zip). Note that its far from a finished control – the animation that happens when you click on it was just me messing around with Blend and the intention is for it to allow full navigation and selection. 
  

XBAP demo (27kb) can be launched from [here](http://www.spencen.com/Samples/DesktopCalendarXbap/DesktopCalendarXbap.xbap) – note that XBAP version doesn’t have any drop shadows.
