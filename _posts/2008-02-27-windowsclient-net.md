I've been following the [WindowsClient.NET](http://windowsclient.net) blog for some time now and have been really impressed with some of the content. In addition to some great [tutorial videos](http://windowsclient.net/learn/videos_wpf.aspx) on the site itself there have been some really good links to code fragments - such as:
 

*   [Dragging and dropping between WPF ItemsControls](http://windowsclient.net/downloads/folders/wpfsamples/entry15467.aspx)
*   Series showing [the magic of adorners (I've been using these a bit) and creating your own design surface](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/WPFDiagramDesigner_Part3.aspx)
*   Series on [Building Business Applications in WPF](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/WPFBusinessAppsPartTwo.aspx) 

Great content - [great feed](http://windowsclient.net/blogs/MainFeed.aspx?GroupID=3&amp;Type=AllBlogs).
