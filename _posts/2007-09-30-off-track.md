Ok - I've managed to get a little side-tracked - there are just so many things rummaging around in my head at the moment.
 

This one popped into (virtual) reality the other day - a WPF based application notification area (status panel). The idea is that the panel interacts with a validation engine which governs **all** validation on a given page. It would also be related to a WPF equivalent of ErrorProvider. The WinForms ErrorProvider was kinda cool for doing simple demos but in real apps I always thought it was a bit of a joke. I'm aiming here to produce "notifications" that have associated metadata - primary text, secondary text (the long version), actions (e.g. intellisense options, corrective measures), locators (e.g. click to focus on the bad control) etc.
 

Based on previous experience most of this is really easy - its the rules validation engine that gets tricky - especially when table validation is required (e.g. grids).
