Someone was kind enough to ask for the source code for a [very simple word puzzle application](http://blog.spencen.com/2008/11/30/a-simple-word-puzzle.aspx) that I put together a few months ago (mainly whilst commuting on the bus). I’ve messed around with it a few times since that original post – but there are no noteworthy changes. Its still very much unfinished – and likely to remain so.
  

Here’s the [source code](http://www.spencen.com/Downloads/WordPuzzle.zip), and a <a href="https://www.spencen.com/WordPuzzle/AlphabetXbap.xbap" target="_blank">link to the XBAP game itself</a>.
