I normally try to ignore the ulterior motives behind <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/" target="_blank">coding horror</a> posts – but I think <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001201.html" target="_blank">this one</a> turned out to be quite a gem. [Just a shame it wasn’t titled “Go and support 2dboy” rather than blathering on about software piracy]. If you’re into physics based puzzle games then check out <a href="http://www.worldofgoo.com" target="_blank">World of Goo</a>. Not bad for <a href="http://2dboy.com/games.php" target="_blank">AU$30.10</a>, and good fun for all the family. If you’re not sure then check out the demo – only 32Mb and has a heap of levels included.
