![HDR-CX550V](/images/HDR-CX550V.png "HDR-CX550V")![DCR-PC100E](/images/DCR-PC100E.png "DCR-PC100E")I finally got around to replacing my trusty video camera – a Sony DCR-PC100E purchased back in 1999. It was one of the early Mini DV cameras, packed full of manual options in what was then an incredibly compact body. In fact the camera I’m replacing it with ([HDR-CX550V](http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;productId=8198552921666073231)) is about the same weight and size and has pretty much the same feature set (viewfinder, manual focus, night shot). Of course everything is now HD and records to memory rather than tape which makes all the difference. I guess the main sign of progress though is that the new camera cost me 1/4 of what I paid for the old one.
  

Having now had the chance to see an play with one first hand, I’m more convinced than ever that the iPad is an awkward form factor that just doesn’t compete well with the existing alternatives. I almost laughed out loud when I saw a guy trying to play a game on one in a busy subway. Kudos to him for being such a die-hard fan!
  

Rob Relyea sparked an [interesting discussions on Sliverlight vs WPF](http://blogs.windowsclient.net/rob_relyea/archive/2010/05/06/did-you-debate-using-silverlight-or-wpf-for-a-project.aspx#319960) which was fairly relevant to some talks we’ve been having at work recently. I was so impressed by the first commenter’s response – [Mike Strobel](http://codedreams.blogspot.com/) - that I subscribed to his blog where he also had a very [interesting take on the Windows Phone 7 UI](http://codedreams.blogspot.com/2010/04/windows-phone-7-ux-part-1-usability.html). I have to admit I share many of Mike’s misgivings about the new UI.
