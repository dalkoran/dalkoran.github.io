I spent last weekend away with the family touring around Kangaroo Island. I managed to take a few photos of the “mandatory” tourist spots. I’ve become quite a fan of taking panoramic photos the easy way – i.e. standing in one spot and taking multiple photos at different angles with a relatively constant horizon.
  

Back in the “good ‘ol days” I used to spend hours stitching the individual photos together afterwards. This involved difficult colour matching, transforms to cater for perspective, manual touchups/blurs of the edges etc. These days I simply select the photos (in any order) using Windows Live Photo Gallery and then choose “Create panoramic photo…”. Hey presto – all done!
  

Here’s a few samples – click for larger versions. These are all taken with a 6 year old digital camera by a novice photographer (me).
